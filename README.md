# Electrical Engineer with Experience in Protections and Programming

Hello! I am an electrical engineer with experience in short-circuit studies, protection coordination, and arc flash hazard assessment. My passion lies in the field of electrical protections, and I am currently focused on working with SEL and Cutler Hammer relays.

## Experience and Skills

- Short-Circuit Studies: Detailed analysis of short circuits to evaluate the system's fault withstand capability and provide protection against damages.

- Protection Coordination: Configuration of relays and settings to ensure selectivity and an appropriate response to faults.

- Arc Flash Hazard Assessment: Evaluation and mitigation of arc flash risks to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment in electrical installations.

## Interests

- Electrical Protections: Enthusiastic about designing and configuring protection systems, particularly with SEL and Cutler Hammer relays.

- Programming: I am currently developing a new skill by learning programming in Python and JavaScript. Open to new projects that combine my electrical engineering expertise with programming.
